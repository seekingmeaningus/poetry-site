title: One More Beautiful Day in the Hood
---

as I view a lovely, cool, and verdant summer morning
by the Shenandoah, after a series of very hot days,
I am relishing the beauty that constantly surrounds me,
and I wonder where to place my gratitude,
as I am not much of a believer, and do not know
what to call the miracle I inhabit…

for no name is adequate, no definition can define it,
the words we possess, like environment, seems cold
and heartless and lacking in appropriate reverence,
and language is a pale substitute for the reality
of a world of mystery and wonder and infinite delights
in every day I am able to witness what my senses bring…

And I remember Mr. Rogers, a gentle and meek man
whose depth I failed to see, and someone’s post on facebook said,
“Today’s Special, and so are You”, and I can only offer
my small smile, and be amused at my small vision,
how little I know, which gets smaller and smaller,
as I get older, knowing less and less about more and more,
until I will know everything about nothing.
